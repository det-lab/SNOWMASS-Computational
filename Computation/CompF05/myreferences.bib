                   accelerators and colliders -- both lepton and hadron
                   machines, which have enabled several major discoveries in
                   elementary particle physics. To ensure continued progress in
                   the field, U.S. leadership as a key partner in building next
                   generation collider facilities abroad is essential; also
                   critically important is the exploring of options to host a
                   future collider in the U.S. The ``Snowmass'' study and the
                   subsequent Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel
                   (P5) process provide the timely opportunity to develop
                   strategies for both. What we do now will shape the future of
                   our field and whether the U.S. will remain a world leader in
                   these areas. In this white paper, we briefly discuss the US
                   engagement in proposed collider projects abroad and describe
                   future collider options for the U.S. We also call for
                   initiating an integrated R\&D program for future colliders.",

                   advanced accelerator concepts being investigated by Snowmass

                   the United States. The European Strategy has endorsed an
                   electron-positron Higgs factory as its highest priority
                   after HL-LHC. Much of the detector, software, and physics

                   number of challenges that a strong role in the study of the

                   scientific results, maintaining leading roles in
                   international partnerships, nurturing and advancing
                   world-leading capabilities and expert resources, and
                   maintaining and attracting talent. The international effort

Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language.

abstract = {Large HPC centers spend considerable time supporting software for thousands of users, but the complexity of HPC software is quickly outpacing the capabilities of existing software management tools. Scientific applications require specific versions of compilers, MPI, and other dependency libraries, so using a single, standard software stack is infeasible. However, managing many configurations is difficult because the configuration space is combinatorial in size. We introduce Spack, a tool used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to manage this complexity. Spack provides a novel, recursive specification syntax to invoke parametric builds of packages and dependencies. It allows any number of builds to coexist on the same system, and it ensures that installed packages can find their dependencies, regardless of the environment. We show through real-world use cases that Spack supports diverse and demanding applications, bringing order to HPC software chaos.},

volume={3},

pages={160018},
abstract={There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

abstract={Particle physics has an ambitious and broad experimental programme for the coming decades. This programme requires large investments in detector hardware, either to build new facilities and experiments, or to upgrade existing ones. Similarly, it requires commensurate investment in the R{\&}D of software to acquire, manage, process, and analyse the shear amounts of data to be recorded. In planning for the HL-LHC in particular, it is critical that all of the collaborating stakeholders agree on the software goals and priorities, and that the efforts complement each other. In this spirit, this white paper describes the R{\&}D activities required to prepare for this software upgrade.},
